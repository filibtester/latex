Software for writing mathematical formulas based on Tex. 
It is a document preparation system. 
It has been created by mathematician Leslie Lamport in the early 1980s.  
In the first tutorial I write the area of a rectangle with a formula.
The code is inside the tex file while the document is inside the PDF.
